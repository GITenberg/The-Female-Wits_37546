<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>


<p><i>The Female Wits; Or, The Triumvirate of Poets at Rehearsal</i>,
published anonymously in 1704 with "written by Mr. W. M."
on the titlepage, was played at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane
around October, 1696. <a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> A devastating satire in the manner of
Buckingham's <i>The Rehearsal</i>, it attacks all plays by women playwrights
but Mary de la Riviere Manley's blood and thunder female
tragedy, <i>The Royal Mischief</i> (1696), in particular. <i>The Female
Wits</i> resembles <i>The Rehearsal</i> in that the satire is directed
not only at the subject matter and style of a particular type of
drama but supplies searing portrayals of recognizable persons&mdash;in
this case, of Mrs. Manley herself, and to a lesser degree, of
Mary Pix and Catherine Trotter (later Cockburn). It also follows
Buckingham's satire in that the actors play double roles&mdash;that of
the characters assigned to them and their own&mdash;and in so doing,
reveal their own personalities with astonishing clarity.</p>

<p>Colley Cibber tells the best stories of the chaos that ensued
after the secession of Betterton and most of the veteran actors in
1695 from the dominance of Christopher Rich at Drury Lane. <a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Since Betterton had been virtual dictator in London since 1682,
he was able to command the efforts, at least at first, of most of
the well-known playwrights who had written for the company before
the establishment of his theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields.
Young playwrights scrambled to ingratiate themselves with one
or the other of the two London managements. Among them, there
had been three women with four plays in less than a year.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Manley arrived upon the dramatic scene with her
first play, <i>The Lost Lover; Or, The Jealous Husband</i>, in March,
1696, she bore the brunt of a growing criticism against a surfeit
of female plays. But when she protested in the preface of the
printed version that "I think my Treatment much severer than I
deserv'd; I am satisfied the bare Name of being a Woman's Play
damn'd it beyond its own want of Merit," she took upon herself
the combined animus of the masculine critics. In the same preface,
she challenged them boldly with "Once more, my Offended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span>Judges, I am to appear before you, once more in possibility of
giving you the like Damning Satisfaction; there is a Tragedy of
mine Rehearsing, which 'tis too late to recall, I consent it meet
with the same Fortune." The other play was <i>The Royal Mischief</i>.</p>

<p>One learns from <i>The Female Wits</i> that Mrs. Manley considered
herself privileged at Drury Lane, that <i>The Royal Mischief</i> had
gone into rehearsal, but that her imperious manner had alienated
the actors who laughed at her dramatic pretentions; and that she
had stormed out of the Theatre Royal vowing never again to honor
them with her works. After much bickering among patrons, patentees,
players, and playwright, <i>The Royal Mischief</i> was finally
presented by the newly formed Betterton company at Lincoln's
Inn Fields in May, 1696, instead of by the company of actors led
by George Powell at the rival Drury Lane Theatre. At least, this
is what is represented in <i>The Female Wits</i>, and although highly
exaggerated, it is essentially true. The time: March or April,
1696.</p>

<p><i>The Female Wits</i> is correctly compared in its preface to the
satiric masterpiece which had been written as a corrective to the
bombastic tragedy supplied by Dryden, Howard, and others in the
early years of the Restoration. With <i>The Rehearsal</i>, Buckingham
and his fellow wits had supposedly succeeded in laughing heroic
tragedy into oblivion in the 1670's. By the 1690's, another type
of heroic drama, equally unrealistic but tinged with sentimentality,
was enjoying a certain success. The chief purveyors of this
new drama which pleased the Ladies were a group of women who
seemed impervious to masculine criticism. In the 1690's, therefore,
another set of self-appointed critics evidently dedicated itself
to laughing the female authors off the stage. <i>A Comparison
between the Two Stages</i>, an anonymous satirical summary of drama
from 1695 to 1702, echoes the attitude of the author of <i>The Female
Wits</i> toward women playwrights. When <i>The Lost Lover</i>, Mrs. Manley's
first play, is brought up for discussion, Critick demands</p>

<blockquote>
What occasion had you to name a Lady in the confounded<br />
Work you're about?</blockquote>
<p>
Sullen: Here's a Play of hers.<br />
<br />
Critick: The Devil there is: I wonder in my Heart we are so lost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to all Sense and Reason: What a Pox have the Women to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do with the Muses? I grant you the Poets call the Nine<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muses by the Names of Women, but why so? not because<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Sex had any thing to do with Poetry, but because in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Sex they're much fitter for prostitution.<br />
<br />
Rambler: Abusive, now you're abusive, Mr. Critick.<br />
<br />
Critick: Sir, I tell you we are abus'd: I hate these Petticoat-Authors;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'tis false Grammar, there's no Feminine for the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Latin word, 'tis entirely of the Masculine Gender.... Let<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'em scribble on, till they can serve all the Pastry-cooks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Town, the Tobacconists and Grocers with Waste-paper<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.<br />
</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Although <i>The Royal Mischief</i> was the immediate pretext for
<i>The Female Wits</i>, the true cause of the attack was the surprising
success of the women playwrights with the Ladies in the boxes
who were beginning to enjoy the "Solace of Tears" and to dominate
theatrical taste in the middle 1690's. After Aphra Behn's death
in 1689, a shattering blow to rising feminism, women had not ventured
thus far to write for the stage. Mrs. Behn, however, was
still a powerful influence, and her name was invoked by every
woman who put pen to paper.</p>

<p>Mrs. Manley openly aspired to be a second Astrea. Certainly
there are striking similarities. As in Aphra Behn's case, nothing
Mrs. Manley ever wrote as drama or fiction could equal the events
of her own life<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. Her father died when she was fourteen, leaving
her in the care of a cousin who took her inheritance, went through
a sham marriage with her, abandoned her before their child was
born, and left her to starve before she was sixteen. She was befriended
by Barbara Castlemaine, Duchess of Cleveland, the notorious
former mistress of Charles II, whose character Mrs. Manley
draws as Hillaria in <i>The Adventures of Rivella</i> (1714), and whose
lineaments are certainly to be seen in the character of Homais in
the warmer passages of <i>The Royal Mischief</i>. After Mrs. Manley's
cruel dismissal by the Duchess, by her own account she spent
two years wandering unknown from place to place in England, and
during this time, she wrote plays for her diversion.</p>

<p>During the 1690's, despite the supposition of some modern
critics that heroic tragedy was out of style, the great classics
of the three preceding decades continued to be played by the
Betterton company in whose stock repertory they had been since
their inception: Lee's <i>The Rival Queens</i>, Banks' <i>The Unhappy</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
<i>Favourite</i>, Otway's <i>Venice Preserv'd</i>, and many of Dryden's (<i>The
Indian Emperour</i>, <i>The Conquest of Granada</i>, <i>All for Love</i>). In
fact, Dryden was still writing and pleasing audiences with tragicomedies
that contained the ingredients of the old heroic tragedy.
Since the same company of actors was presenting the old plays
(indeed, most of the actors were still playing their original roles),
the histrionic magic of the early tragic hero could still lift an
audience to the empyrean heights reached in the heady first years
of the restoration of Charles II. If there is anything strange in
Mrs. Manley's <i>The Royal Mischief</i> in 1696, it is not that it was
an heroic play but that the leading character was a woman, Homais,
who out-hectors and out-loves all of the Restoration Alexanders,
Montezumas, and Drawcansirs written for and by men.</p>

<p>If her own account of <i>The Royal Mischief</i> is true, Mrs. Manley
wrote it after she left the household of the Duchess of Cleveland,
some time between 1692 and 1694. Since there was only one
theatre in London from 1682 to 1695, she wrote for Thomas Betterton,
Elizabeth Barry, Anne Bracegirdle, Edward Kynaston, and
other veterans in the Betterton company, who were the prototypes
for the characters in the early heroic plays. She could have known
no others. When Betterton seceded from the Theatre Royal in
1695 and set up the independent theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields,
Mrs. Manley, already committed to Drury Lane because of her first
play, gave Drury Lane <i>The Royal Mischief</i> even though it had been
written for the Betterton company. Circumstances, then, dictated
that <i>The Royal Mischief</i> was finally played by the actors for whom
it had been written originally.</p>

<p>It is likely, however, that <i>The Female Wits</i> would never have
been written if Thomas Betterton had not aggravated the situation
by producing <i>The Royal Mischief</i> as quickly as possible after Mrs.
Manley had withdrawn it from Drury Lane under such provocative
circumstances. It was played immediately at Lincoln's Inn Fields
in April or May, 1696, seemingly at the insistence of the Duke of
Devonshire to whom Mrs. Manley dedicated it. When it was published
in June, the author was supported by her sister playwrights
in commendatory verses included with the play. Catherine Trotter
possibly earned her inclusion in <i>The Female Wits</i> when she wrote,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>
You were our Champion, and the Glory ours.<br />
Well you've maintain'd our equal right in Fame,<br />
To which vain Man had quite engrost the claim:<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Mary Pix confirmed her place in the satire with her panegyric:</p>

<blockquote><p>
You the unequal'd wonder of the Age,<br />
Pride of our Sex, and Glory of the Age,<br />
Like Sappho Charming, like Afra Eloquent,<br />
Like Chast Orinda, sweetly Innocent.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Manley minced no words in the printed version in answer
to the flurry of criticism that had greeted <i>The Royal Mischief</i>
when it was played: "I should not have given my self and the
Town the trouble of a Preface if the aspersions of my Enemies
had not made it necessary." According to her, in spite of "ill
nature, Envy, and Detraction," <i>The Royal Mischief</i> was successful
(it had a run of six nights) even though some of the ladies
professed to be shocked at "the warmth of it, as they are pleas'd
to call it.... I do not doubt when the Ladies have given themselves
the trouble of reading, and comparing it with others, they'll find
the prejudice against our Sex, and not refuse me the satisfaction
of entertaining them...." Everything Mrs. Manley wrote, however,
simply added to the ridicule that had been mounting against women
playwrights, and <i>The Female Wits</i> is merely the distillation of the
general attitude of the self-appointed critics and wits at the Rose
and the Grecian, at Maynwaring's and at Will's.</p>

<p>In defending <i>The Royal Mischief</i> and its reception, she said
of the actress who played the unbelievably wicked Homais: "... Mrs.
Barry, who by all that saw her, is concluded to have exceeded
that perfection which before she was justly thought to have arrived
at; my Obligations to her were the greater, since against her own
approbation, she excell'd and made the part of an ill Woman, not
only entertaining, but admirable." Years later in <i>The Adventures
of Rivella</i>, she was to say, "Mrs. Barry distinguish'd herself as
much as in any Part that ever she play'd. I have since heard Rivella
laugh and wonder that a Man of Mr. Betterton's grave Sense
and Judgment should think well enough of the Productions of a
Woman of Eighteen, to bring it upon the Stage in so handsome a
Manner as he did...." <a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>It is easy to believe Mrs. Manley's high commendation of the
actress but difficult to credit Mrs. Barry's objection to playing a
part that was a natural sequel to all the heroic and sometimes
wicked women she had played throughout her career. Her audience
identified her with Lee's Roxana in <i>The Rival Queens</i>, Dryden's
Cleopatra in <i>All for Love</i>, and his recent Cassandra in <i>Cleomenes</i>.
Every playwright since 1680 had written expressly for her: Otway's
Monimia in <i>The Orphan</i> was her first great part in 1680, followed
two years later by Belvidera in <i>Venice Preserv'd</i>. Southerne had
given her Isabella in <i>The Fatal Marriage</i> in 1694, Congreve was
still to write for her his Zara in <i>The Mourning Bride</i> in 1697, and
Rowe his Calista in <i>The Fair Penitent</i> in 1703. Cibber, in 1740,
remembered her "Presence of elevated Dignity ... her Voice full,
clear, and strong, so that no Violence of Passion could be too
much for her." He emphasized that in "Scenes of Anger, Defiance,
or Resentment, while she was impetuous, and terrible, she pour'd
out the Sentiment with an enchanting Harmony." <a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Barry's ability and her strength of voice in expressing
the passions led to the full development of the rant, which was the
test of the dramatic actress as the aria is the test of the opera
singer. Ordinarily in a tragedy, there were two: one, the melodious
expression of unattainable love in the first part of the play,
and the second in the death scene, usually of raving madness. In
<i>The Royal Mischief</i>, there are at least six major rants, each more
powerful and surprising than the one preceding it. If Mrs. Barry's
ability was ever tested, it was with Mrs. Manley's Homais.</p>

<p>The story is that of another Messalina. Homais, married to
the unloved Prince of Libardian, had had many lovers in her progress
to the throne of Phasia: among them, Ismael, who had remained
her creature and is willing to kill the Prince for one more
night's favors. Even her eunuch Acmat is more than a mere pander
to her desire for her husband's nephew, Levan Dadian, whom she
has never seen but for whom she writhes nightly upon her bed in
erotic desire, stimulated only by his life size picture and secondhand
descriptions of him. She conspires with Acmat to inflame
Levan Dadian with desire for her (her portrait was enough) and to
bring about a meeting even though that prince was bringing home
with him his virtuous bride, Bassima, princess of Colchis. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
proposal to enslave Levan Dadian might have been difficult if it
had not been for the fact that years before, during a war between
Phasia and Colchis, Osman, great general and now Chief Vizier
to the Prince of Libardian, had captured Bassima, fallen in love
with her (and she with him), but without a word on either side
before and after he had freed her, they had remained platonically
true to each other in spite of the passage of years, Osman's
marriage to Selima, sister of his Prince, the offer (and rejection)
of Homais' love, and of Bassima's recent marriage to Levan
Dadian. When Levan Dadian brings Bassima to court, the recognition
between Osman and Bassima is endured in silence, but the
trusting Osman bares his heart to Homais' creature Ismael, who
inflames the hitherto platonic Osman with unholy desire for the
pure Bassima. The wily Acmat insinuates distrust for Bassima
into Levan Dadian's heart at the same time that he inspires lust
for Homais and brings about the promised meeting. Homais immediately
sets about disposing of everyone who stands in her
way. The Prince of Libardian is to be dispatched by Ismael.
Osman is to be accused of infidelity with Bassima, who is to be
poisoned by Ismael. Word of this gets to Osman, who urges Bassima
to flee with or without him, but she refuses because her
virtue would be called into question in either case. But plans
go awry, the Prince is not dispatched, and while Levan Dadian
is absent, Homais is seized by her husband and given the choice
of drinking poison or submitting to death by the bow-string. She
charms him out of killing her, and he, overcome by her beauty,
weakly believes her promises and sets her free to pursue her
wickedness.</p>

<p>Bassima, however, has been poisoned and is dying when
Osman comes to her, urging the consumation of their passion
then and there, before it is too late. Her gentle refusal to stray
from virtue on her deathbed awakens him from his unplatonic
spell, and he begs forgiveness but is interrupted in the middle
of his contrite speech, led away, crammed alive into a cannon,
and shot off. The soldiers, led by Ismael, revolt in favor of
Homais and declare her queen. For a heady moment, she has
attained her every desire as she stands exulting over the dying
Bassima, whose husband is somewhat disturbed by the turn of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
events but whose attention is diverted when Homais takes him in
her arms. But at the height of her triumph, the Prince burst in,
sword in hand, and runs Homais through before she can change
his mind. Unrepenting to the end, she goes to her death and into
her final rant with defiance on her lovely lusty lips as she ticks
off the men in her life one by one. In the last three minutes,
Osman's faithful but jealous wife gathers his smoking remains,
Levan Dadian falls on his sword, and the Prince of Libardian
ends the play with</p>

<blockquote><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O horrour, horrour, horrour!<br />
What Mischief two fair Guilty Eyes have wrought;<br />
Let Lovers all look here, and shun the Dotage.<br />
To Heaven my dismal Thoughts shall straight be turn'd,<br />
And all these sad Dissasters truly mourn'd.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>There is no need to point out that <i>The Royal Mischief</i> invited
parody. Everything was in excess. No woman had ever
been so lustfully wicked as Homais (played by Elizabeth Barry),
no heroine so pure as Bassima (Anne Bracegirdle), no hero so
faithfully platonic (Thomas Betterton), no husband so duped as
the Prince of Libardian (Edward Kynaston), no wife so weakly
jealous as Selima (Elizabeth Bowman), no man so easily a prey
to lust as Levan Dadian (John Bowman), so much a creature as
Ismael (John Hodgson), so vile a tool as Acmat (John Freeman).
Each character was a stick figure for a single quality. Incidents
happened so rapidly that continual surprise is the predominant
emotion if one discounts the miasma of hot surging sex that
hovers over the entire production. But it must have been effective
when played by the greatest actors in London.</p>

<p>After reading both plays, one can believe that immediately
after the presentation of <i>The Royal Mischief</i>, someone began
putting together the parodies of obviously over-written scenes
and high-flown language, burlesques of heroic acting by the acknowledged
past-masters of the art, Thomas Betterton and Elizabeth
Barry, as well as the mincing pasquinade of Anne Bracegirdle,
who was as virtuous as the pure role she played. Since
<i>The Royal Mischief</i> was played in May, near the end of the season,
there was ample time to gloat over its absurdities during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
the summer months and have <i>The Female Wits</i> ready for the delectation
of the Town early the following season. Like all satires,
it had its day while the original was still fresh in the minds of the
theatre-going public but was immediately forgotten because <i>The
Royal Mischief</i> did not become a stock play.</p>

<p><i>The Female Wits</i> is a continuous hilarious romp of scenes
from <i>The Royal Mischief</i> and an entire gallery of burlesqued
portraits of the famous actors who were as much under fire as
Mrs. Manley herself. Elizabeth Barry's histrionic style of acting
is held up to derision when Frances Maria Knight, who was playing
the character satirizing Homais as well as a caricature of
Mrs. Barry, is told to "stamp like Queen Statira does ... that always
gets a Clap. No Stamp, and Hug yourself: Oh the strong Exstasie!"
When Homais is stabbed, Marsilia gives the order, "D'ye
hear, Property Man, be sure some red Ink is handsomely convey'd
to Mrs. Knight." Penkethman, a short, slap-stick comedian mimicking
six-foot Betterton as the faithful Osman is told to "Fetch
long Strides; walk thus; your Arms strutting, your voice big, and
your Eyes terrible"; and later, "Louder ... strain your Voice: I tell
you, Mr. Pinkethman, this speaking Loud gets the Clap." Mrs.
Bracegirdle's famous "pathetic" style of acting is parodied when
Marsilia instructs Miss Cross how to speak a line: "Give me
leave to instruct you in a moving Cry. Oh! there's a great deal of
Art in crying: Hold your Handkerchief thus; let it meet your Eyes,
thus; your Head declin'd, thus; now, in a perfect whine, crying out
these words,</p>

<p class="center">
By these Tears, which never cease to Flow."<br />
</p>

<p>Reverse situations are used as comic devices. Possibly the
climax of absurdity is reached when Miss Cross and Penkethman,
instead of dying horrible deaths, find themselves on the roof-top
(instead of in the dungeon) climbing into a celestial chariot that
the Prince had been building for fifty years. They escape their
pursuing enemies, thus making merry with the tragic conclusion
of <i>The Royal Mischief</i> and using the same theatrical machinery
that was being employed in <i>Brutus of Alba</i>. Marsilia caps this
scene by describing in detail the events which were played seriously
in <i>The Royal Mischief</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>You must know, my Lord, at first I design'd this for a
Tragedy; and they were both taken; She was Poyson'd,
and dy'd, like an Innocent Lamb, as she was indeed:
I was studying a Death for him; once I thought Boys
shou'd shoot him to Death with Pot-Guns; ... and that
wou'd have been Disgrace enough, you know: But at
length I resolv'd to ram him into a great Gun, and
scatter him o're the sturdy Plain: This, I say, was
my first resolve. But I consider'd, 'twou'd break
the Lady's Heart; so there is nothing in their Parts
Tragical; but as your Lordship shall see miraculously
I turn'd it into an Opera.</p></blockquote>

<p>The continual interruptions in the rehearsal by Marsilia
giving orders to the increasingly irritated actors, their hostile
asides as they come out of their roles to ask bewildered questions,
object to her directions, or attempt to resign their parts
keep the stage in an uproar. The asinine remarks of her sycophantic
followers, her own erratic behavior which culminates in
her rage and her stalking out, vowing to take her play to Lincoln's
Inn Fields, while George Powell, Mrs. Knight, and Miss Cross
double up with laughter&mdash;all make <i>The Female Wits</i> an hilarious
piece of dramatic satire as well as a valuable theatrical document.</p>

<p>All but forgotten, as it was when it was published in 1704,
the played version of <i>The Female Wits</i> had its impact on women
playwrights in 1696. Mrs. Manley did not produce another play
until <i>Almyna</i> was acted in Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1706, ten years
later. As a result of the unjustified attack upon her, Mrs. Pix
thereafter wrote for Lincoln's Inn Fields, and at the beginning
of the 1697-98 season was engaged in a name-calling dispute
with Drury Lane over the flagrant plagiarism of one of her plays
by George Powell, the actor who figures prominently in <i>The
Female Wits</i>. Mrs. Trotter gave her plays to the Betterton group
until 1700 when a new management regulated affairs at Drury
Lane.</p>

<p>Whether Mrs. Manley was driven from the stage for ten years
by the jeers of the Town is a matter of debate. She became one
of the leading Tory pamphleteers, political editors, and literary
hacks in London, employed for years and respected in an odd way
by such people as Richard Steele and Dean Swift. Her most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
famous work, <i>The Secret Memoirs and Manners of Several Persons of
Quality ... by the New Atalanta</i> (1709) and her semi-autobiographical
<i>The Adventures of Rivella</i> (1714) caused government inquiries, and
she never ceased to be a controversial figure.</p>

<p>Up to the present time, no one has ventured to say who wrote
<i>The Female Wits</i>. The titlepage gives "Mr. W. M." as the author,
but this information is immediately refuted by the preface signed
"W. M." which gives most of the facts of composition, performance,
and publication. According to the preface, the satire was written
by a friend (now dead), and the "Quality" had insisted it be played
at Drury Lane, where it had enjoyed a run of six nights and could
have continued longer "had the Company thought fit to oblige the
Taste of the Town in General rather than that of some particular
Persons." <i>The Female Wits</i> was published in 1704 even though
"the Town has almost lost the Remembrance of it," but unless the
taste of the critics today is different from what it was in 1696,
readers cannot fail to have as much satisfaction as the earlier
audience had in seeing it. W. M.'s identification of Mrs. Manley
as Marsilia, Mrs. Pix as Mrs. Wellfed, and Mrs. Trotter as Calista
as well as his commendation of the acting of Mr. and Mrs. Powell,
and his praise of Mrs. Verbruggen (now deceased also) are expressions
of nostalgia from a man whose duty to his dead friend is now
accomplished. He ends his laconic preface with a reference to the
reformers led by Jeremy Collier, "a Fig for their Censures, which
can neither affect him that Wrote this Play, nor him that Publishes
it." <a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>It is evident that the anonymous author knew all of the actors
at Drury Lane intimately: "honest" George Powell, who "regards
neither Times nor Seasons in Drinking," Mrs. Lucas, the dancer,
and her coffee habit, hoydenish Letitia Cross with her sassy aside of
"now have I such a mind to kick him i'th'chops" about some show-off
fop who wished to kiss the strap of her shoe in homage, Frances
Marie Knight's haughty withdrawal from any complication with
Mrs. Manley or the other playwrights. His knowledge of Mrs.
Manley's colossal arrogance, of Mrs. Pix's easy-going acceptance
of her great bulk and lack of charm, of beautiful Mrs. Trotter's
considerable learning in the classics and her early tendency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
toward critical writing&mdash;all are sharply etched from observation
and intimate knowledge.</p>

<p><i>The Female Wits</i> has all the remarks of having been put
together by group effort, and the evidence points to the actors
at Drury Lane, a number of whom had already shown writing ability:
Joseph Haynes, Colley Cibber, Hildebrand Horden, and
George Powell. Especially George Powell had been active with
four plays and two operas already to his credit, one of which,
<i>Brutus of Alba</i>, must have been running concurrently with <i>The
Female Wits</i> in October, 1696. Because <i>The Female Wits</i> is
episodic in character, loosely strung together with songs and
dances, it may well have come from various sources recognizable
to the audience. For example, Letitia Cross is asked to
sing "her dialogue," readily consents, and Mr. Leveridge, a
frequent partner, is called to sing the second part. It may or may
not be a coincidence that <i>Brutus of Alba</i> contains a dialogue
between a flirtatious young girl and an impotent old man featuring
Miss Cross <a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. The song achieved a certain notoriety because of
its frankness, was re-issued as a separate piece, and is the type
of entertainment that would have been repeated in a burlesque
like <i>The Female Wits</i>. Other members of the company contribute
their specialities: Miss Cross also performs "her dance," Mr.
Pate sings an Italian Song. The only song that can be identified
positively is "A Scotch Song Sung by Mrs. Lucas at the Theatre,"
the chorus of which one of the characters sings when he asks her to
favor them with her "Last Dance." <a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps Joe Haynes, the famous comedian, best fills the
role of chief author, as Buckingham was credited with the authorship
of <i>The Rehearsal</i>, although it was known that every wit in
Town had a hand in it. For over twenty years, Haynes had played
the part of Bayes, which satirized Dryden, and was recognized as
the zany of the London theatrical world with special licence to
burlesque any person or institution that came under his critical
eye. The same sort of mad inventiveness peculiar to his elaborate
hoaxes upon the public, the incisive satire in his written or
ad-libbed prologues and epilogues, and the special touches added
to the character parts written for him are present in <i>The Female</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
<i>Wits</i>. He had published a mock heroic tragedy (no record of performance)
in 1692 which significantly enjoyed a second printing
in 1696. Because of his scatological language and outrageous
pranks, he was in and out of trouble with the authorities, both
public and theatrical, throughout his career. He was one of the
principal comedians through the period under consideration, had
been in Mrs. Manley's first play (as indeed had all of the principal
players in <i>The Female Wits</i>), and would have been one of
the first to resent Mrs. Manley's haughty manner; since he had
nothing to lose, he would have been the logical ring-leader in
satirizing both the playwright and the veteran actors at Lincoln's
Inn Fields.</p>

<p>With so much writing and acting talent among the hungry,
ambitious player-authors at Drury Lane, there is little need to
look far afield, but Haynes does qualify in another special way
for authorship. W. M. states that the author was dead before
1704. Haynes died in June, 1701, and Tobyas Thomas,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the
author of <i>The Life of the Late Famous Comedian, Jo. Hayns</i>, a
picaresque, jest-book type of biography published the same year,
reveals the interesting information in the dedicatory epistle to
William Mann that Haynes had been a friend and visitor in Mann's
home at Charnham in Kent, and that Mann had encouraged Thomas
to write the biography. Whether William Mann is Mr. W. M. and
the comedian is the friend in the preface to <i>The Female Wits</i> may
never be known, but Joe Haynes, aided and abetted by fellow
actors, patrons, friends, and self-appointed critics, all of them
with a reason to satirize the female writers and the too-successful
actors at Lincoln's Inn Fields, could easily have headed up
the group effort that resulted in the <i>commedia del arte</i> concoction
that finally saw print in 1704.</p>

<p>The prologue and epilogue were added at the time of publication.
Topical allusions range from the Collier Controversy,
which began in 1698 and continued actively for more than a
decade, to John Tutchin, controversial editor of <i>The Observator</i>
(which began in 1702), to a mention of the great storm of November
26, 1703, which Collier and his followers believed to be a
punishment for England's wickedness, to the proclamation early
in 1704 by Queen Anne prohibiting the wearing of masks at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
playhouses. More important, however, is the fact that the tone
of the prologue and epilogue is entirely different from that found
in the play. The tempered language of a decade later than the
play is not in keeping with the raucous satire directed at the
three women playwrights and the rival actors at Lincoln's Inn
Fields that must have kept the audience in a roar of laughter.</p>

<p><i>The Female Wits</i> is an important document to historians of
the theatre, coming as it did at the very end of the Restoration
period and just preceding the changes brought about by Collier's
attacks upon the theatre which accelerated the establishment of
sentimental comedy and tragedy. The play illuminates at least
four areas about which we know very little: the personalities of
the three women playwrights at the beginning of their careers, the
excellent portraits of some of the little known players, the acting
techniques that are parodied so broadly that it is possible to recognize
the original practice, and the rehearsal customs and stage
directions employed which give new light or confirm what is already
known. Granted, all are outrageously exaggerated, but a
discerning eye can detect the truth that lurks behind any satire,
parody, or lampoon. That kernel of truth must be there, or there
is nothing to laugh about.</p>

Wing notes a 1697 edition, but an examination of the severely
cropped copy of the 1704 edition at the Huntington Library gives the
first clue for the creation of a ghost: the imprint was sacrificed to
the Kemble-Devonshire insistence on uniformity in size, and a later
hand supplied the conjectured date of presentation, not the date of
publication. Noted as a questioned publication date in Woodward-McManaway,
<i>Check List</i> (no. 374), the date of 1697 was next cautiously
recorded in Nicoll (<i>Ibidem</i>) as a possible date for a first edition.

<p>Though the Success of this Play has been such,
as to need no Apology for the Publication
of it; it having been Acted six Days running without
intermission; and being likely to have continued
much longer, had the Company thought fit
to oblige the Taste of the Town in General,
rather than that of some particular Persons; yet the
lateness of its appearance abroad, after its being
Acted some Years since with great Applause, seems
to require that the Reader should be satisfied why
it should fall under his Censure at a time when the
Town has almost lost the Remembrance of it. In
order to this, I take it for necessary to Premise, that
the Author of it, a Man of more Modesty than the
Generality of our present Writers, tho' not of less
Merit than the best of 'em, was neither fond of his
own Performances, nor desirous others should fall in
love with them. What he writ was for his own Diversion;
and he could hardly be persuaded by the
Quality to make it theirs, till his good Temper got
the better of his Aversion to write himself among
the List of the Poets; and he was prevail'd upon
to put it into the Hands of the Gentlemen belonging
to the Theatre in <i>Drury-Lane</i>, who did him
the same Justice, as was done by him to Dramatick
Poetry and the Stage. Among the rest, Mr.
<i>Powel</i> and his Wife excell'd in the Characters they
represented, as did Mrs. <i>Verbruggen</i>, who play'd the
Chief Character, and whose Loss we must ever regret,
as the Chief Actress in her Kind, who never had
any one that exceeded her, or ever will have one
that can come up to her, unless a Miracle intervenes
for the support of the <i>English</i> Stage. It is written
in imitation of the Rehearsal; and though we
must not presume to say it comes up to the Character
of the Duke of <i>Buckingham</i>'s Works, yet it does
not fall short of it, so much as many of our Modern
Performances, that please more for the sake of their
Patrons than the real Worth of those that Writ
'em. And to let those that shall give it their Perusal,
into the Knowledge of the Female Wits, who are here
hinted at, they are to understand; the Lady
whose Play is rehears'd, personates one Mrs. <i>M&mdash;ly</i>,
a Gentlewoman sufficiently known for a Correspondence
with the Muses some time since, though she
has of late discontinu'd it, (I presume for some more
profitable Employ) and those that go under the
Names of Mrs. <i>Welfed</i>, and <i>Calista</i>, are Mrs. <i>P&mdash;x</i>
and Mrs. <i>T&mdash;&mdash;r</i>, two Gentlewomen that have made
no small struggle in the World to get into Print;
and who are now in such a State of Wedlock to
Pen and Ink, that it will be very difficult for 'em
to get out of it. Whether the Characters are just
or no, that is left to the Reader's determination:
But the Auditors thought the Pictures were true, or
they would have condemn'd the Person that drew
'em, in less than six Days. What remains is, to
justifie the Publication of it, and to acquaint the
World, that the Author being deceas'd, I got a
Copy of it; and out of my desire to divert the
Publick, I thought it might not be unacceptable
if it saw the Light. In short, if it pleases as much
in the Reading, as it did in the Acting, the Reader
cannot fail of his Satisfaction; if not, the Taste of
the Criticks is different from what it was some
Years since: And so, a Fig for their Censures,
which can neither affect him that Wrote this Play,
nor him that Publishes it.</p>

<p class="center">SCENE a Dressing-Room, Table and
Toylet Furnish'd, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Marsilia <i>in a Night-Gown, followed by</i>
Patience.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Why, thou thoughtless inconsiderable
Animal! Thou driv'ling dreaming
Lump! Is it not past Nine o'Clock?
Must not I be at the Rehearsal by
Ten, Brainless? And here's a Toylet
scarce half furnish'd!</p>

<p><i>Pat.</i> I am about it, Madam.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Yes, like a Snail!&mdash;--.
Mount, my aspiring Spirit! Mount! Hit yon azure Roof, and
justle Gods!                [<i>Repeats.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Pat.</i> Madam, your things are ready.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Abominable! Intollerable! past enduring!      [<i>Stamps.</i>
Speak to me whilst I'm Repeating!
Interrupting Wretch! What, a Thought more worth
Than worlds of thee!&mdash;--what a Thought have I lost!&mdash;
Ay, ay, 'tis gone, 'tis gone beyond the Clouds.      [<i>Cries.</i>
Whither now, Mischievous? Do I use to Dress without Attendance?
So, finely prepar'd, Mrs. Negligence!
I never wear any Patches!</p>

<p><i>Pat.</i> Madam.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I ask you if ever you saw me wear any Patches?
Whose Cook maid wert thou prithee? The Barbarous Noise of
thy Heels is enough to put the Melody of the Muses out of
ones Head.&mdash;&mdash;Almond Milk for my Hands.&mdash;&mdash;Sower!
By Heav'n this Monster designs to Poyson me.</p>

<p><i>Pat.</i> Indeed, Madam; 'tis but just made; I wou'd not offer
such an affront to those charming Hands for the World.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Commended by thee! I shall grow sick of 'em.&mdash;&mdash;
Well, but <i>Patty</i>, are not you vain enough to hope from the
fragments of my Discourse you may pick up a Play?
Come, be diligent, it might pass amongst a Crowd,
And do as well as some of its Predecessors.</p>

<p><i>Pat.</i> Nothing but flattery brings my Lady into a good humour.      [<i>Aside.</i>
With your Ladyship's directions I might aim at something.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> My Necklace.</p>

<p><i>Pat.</i> Here's a Neck! such a Shape! such a Skin!&mdash;--      [<i>Tying it on.</i>
Oh! if I were a Man, I shoud run Mad!</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Humph! The Girl has more Sense than I imagin'd,
She finds out those Perfections all the Beau-mond have admired.&mdash;
Well, <i>Patty</i>, after my Third day I'll give you this Gown and
Pettycoat.</p>

<p><i>Pat.</i> Your Ladyship will make one of Velvet, I suppose.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I guess I may; see who knocks.      [<i>Goes out, and returns.</i></p>

<p><i>Pat.</i> Madam, 'tis Mrs. <i>Wellfed</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> That ill-bred, ill shap'd Creature! Let her come
up, she's foolish and open-hearted, I shall pick something
out of her that may do her Mischief, or serve me to Laugh at.</p>

<p><i>Pat.</i> Madam, you invited her to the Rehearsal this Morning.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> What if I did? she might have attended me at the
Play-house.&mdash;&mdash;Go, fetch her up.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Mrs.</i> Wellfed <i>and</i> Patty.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellfed</i>. Good morrow, Madam.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Your Servant, dear Mrs. <i>Wellfed</i>, I have been longing
for you this Half-hour.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf.</i> 'Tis near Ten.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Ay, my Impertinence is such a Trifle&mdash;But, Madam,
are we not to expect some more of your Works?</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf.</i> Yes; I am playing the Fool again.&mdash;&mdash;
The story is&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Nay, for a Story, Madam, you must give me leave
to say, there's none like mine; The turns are so surprizing,
the Love so passionate, the Lines so strong. 'Gad I'm afraid
there's not a Female Actress in <i>England</i> can reach 'em.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf.</i> My Language!</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Now you talk of Language, what do you think a
Lord said to me t'other day? That he had heard I was a
Traveller, and he believ'd my Voyage had been to the Poets
Elyzium, for mortal Fires cou'd never inspire such words!
Was not this fine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf.</i> Extravagantly fine! But, as I was saying&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Mark but these two Lines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf.</i> Madam, I have heard 'em already; you know
you repeated every word of your Play last Night.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I hope, Mrs. <i>Wellfed</i>, the Lines will bear the being
heard twice and twice, else 'twou'd be bad for the Sparks
who are never absent from the Play-house, and must hear
'em Seventeen or Eighteen Nights together.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf.</i> How Madam<i>!</i> that's Three or Four more
than the <i>Old Batchelour</i> held out.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Madam, I dare affirm there's not two such Lines in
the Play you nam'd: Madam, I'm sorry I am forc'd to tell
you, Interruption is the rudest thing in the World.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf.</i> I am dumb. Pray proceed.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Pray observe.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
<i>My Scorching Raptures make a Boy of <font>Jove</font>,<br />
That Ramping God shall learn of me to Love.</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>My Scorching</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf.</i> Won't the Ladies think some of those Expressions
indecent?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Interrupting again, by Heav'n!&mdash;--Sure, Madam,
I understand the Ladies better than you. To my knowledge
they love words that have warmth, and fire, <i>&amp;c.</i> in 'em.&mdash;Here,
<i>Patty</i>, give me a Glass of <i>Sherry</i>; my Spirits are
gone.&mdash;&mdash;No Manchet Sot! Ah! the Glass      [<i>Brings a Glass.</i>
not clean! She takes this opportunity, because
she knows I never fret before Company, I! do I use to Drink
a Thimble full at a time?&mdash;
Take that to wash your Face.      [<i>Throws it in her Face.</i></p>

<p><i>Pat.</i> These are Poetical Ladies with a Pox to 'em.      (<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> My Service to you Madam, I think you drink in a
Morning.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf.</i> Yes, else I had never come to this bigness,
Madam, to the encreasing that inexhausted spring of Poetry:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
that it may swell, o'erflow, and bless the barren Land.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Incomparable, I protest<i>!</i></p>

<p><i>Pat.</i> Madam <i>Calista</i> to wait upon your Ladyship.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Do you know her Child?</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Oh! 'Tis the vainest; proudest, senseless Thing, she
pretends to Grammar, writes in Mood and Figure; does every
thing methodically.&mdash;&mdash;Poor Creature! She shews me her
Works first; I always commend 'em, with a Design she shou'd
expose 'em, and the Town be so kind to laugh her out of her
Follies.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Wellf.</i> That's hard in a Friend.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> But 'tis very usual.&mdash;&mdash;Dunce! Why do you let
her stay so long?      [<i>Exit Pat. Re-enter with</i> Calista.
My best <i>Calista</i>! The charming'st Nymph of all <i>Apollo</i>'s
Train, let me Embrace thee!</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Wellf.</i> So, I suppose my Reception was preceeded like
this.                                          [<i>Aside.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Pray know this Lady, she is a Sister of ours.</p>

<p><i>Calista.</i> She's big enough to be the Mother of the Muses.      [<i>Aside.</i>
Madam, your Servant.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf</i>. Madam, yours.                        [<i>Salute.</i></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Now here's the Female Triumvirate; methinks
'twou'd be but civil of the Men to lay down their Pens for
one Year, and let us divert the Town, but if we shou'd,
they'd certainly be asham'd ever to take 'em up again.</p>

<p><i>Calis.</i> From yours we expect Wonders.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Has any Celebrated Poet of the Age been lately to
look over any of your Scenes, Madam?</p>

<p><i>Calis.</i> Yes, yes, one that you know, and who makes that
his pretence for daily Visits.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> But I had rather see one dear Player than all the
Poets in the Kingdom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Calis.</i> Good Gad! That you shou'd be in Love with an
Old Man!</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> He is so with me; and you'll grant 'tis a harder
Task to Re-kindle dying Coals, than set Tinder on a Blaze.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Wellf.</i> I guess the Spark. But why then is your Play at
this House?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I thought you had known 't had been an <i>Opera</i>; and
such an <i>Opera</i>! But I wont talk on't, 'till you see it. Mrs.
<i>Wellfed</i>, is not your Lodgings often fill'd with the Cabals of
Poets and Judges?</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Wellf.</i> Faith, Madam, I'll not tell a Lye for the matter;
they never do me the Honour.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I thought so, when I ask'd her.      [<i>Aside to</i> Calista.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Wellf.</i> My Brats are forc'd to appear of my own raising.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Nay, Mrs. <i>Wellfed</i>, they don't come to others to
assist, but admire.</p>

<p><i>Pat.</i> Madam, Mr. <i>Aw'dwell</i> and Mr. <i>Praiseall</i> are below.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Dear Ladies, step in with me, whilst I put on my
Mantua: Bring 'em up, and then come to me.&mdash;&mdash;What
does that <i>Aw'dwell</i> here again to Day? Did not I do him the
Honour to go abroad with him yesterday? Sure that's enough
for his Trifle of a Scarf. Come Ladies.
<i>That Ramping God shall learn of me to Love.</i>       [Exeunt.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Mr.</i> Aw'dwell <i>and Mr.</i> Praiseall.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Aw'dw.</i> So, Mr. <i>Praiseall</i>, you are come, I suppose, to
pay your Tribute of Encomiums to the Fair Lady and her
Works.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> The Lady sometimes does me the Honour to
Communicate; my poor Abilities are at her Service, tho' I
own my self weak.</p>

<p><i>Aw'dw.</i> Then you are not fit for the Ladies Service, to my
Knowledge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> Why, Sir? I was long an <i>Oxonion</i>, 'till a good Estate
and the Practice of the Law, tempted me from my studies.</p>

<p><i>Aw'dw.</i> Sir, I'll tell you my Opinion of the University
Students: They are commonly as dull as they are dirty, and
their Conversation is as wretched as their Feeding; yet every
Man thinks his Parts unquestionable, if he has been at
<i>Oxford</i>.&mdash;&mdash;Now all the Observation I have made of <i>Oxford</i>,
is, it's a good Place to improve Beggars, and to spoil
Gentlemen, to make young Master vain, and think no Body
has Wit but himself.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> While the Lady has more complaisant Sentiments,
yours shan't disturb me, Sir, I assure you.</p>

<p><i>Aw'dw.</i> What is't bewitches me to <i>Marsilia</i>! I know her
a Coquet; I know her vain and ungrateful; yet, wise as
<i>Almanzor</i>, knowing all this, I still love on!      [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> I wish <i>Marsilia</i> wou'd come! That fellow
looks as if he had a Mind to quarrel. I hate the sight of a
bent Brow in a Morning; I am always unlucky the whole
Day after.</p>

<p><i>Aw'dw.</i> Oh, one thing more of your Darling <i>Oxford</i>. You
know, if you get Learning, it robs Man of his noblest Part,
Courage. This your mighty Bard, by Experience owns,
the Learned are Cowards by Profession. Do you feel any
of your Martial Heat returns?</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> Ay, he will quarrel, I find.&mdash;&mdash;      [<i>Aside.</i>
Sir, I was never taught to practice Feats of Arms in a Lady's
Anti-Chamber.</p>

<p><i>Aw'dw.</i> The Fool's afraid: Yet shall I have the Pleasure to
see <i>Marsilia</i> prefer this Fop to me before my Face.      [<i>Exit.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Marsilia, Calista, <i>and Mrs.</i> Wellfed.</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> I must beg your Learned Ladyship's Pardon.
<i>Aristotle</i> never said such a Word, upon my Credit.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Patty</i>,
What an Air these Pinners have<i>?</i> Pull 'em more behind.&mdash;&mdash;Oh
my Stars, she has pull'd my Head-cloaths
off!</p>

<p><i>Calist.</i> I cannot but re-mind you, Madam, you are mistaken;
for I read <i>Aristotle</i> in his own Language: The Translation
may alter the Expression.</p>

<p><i>Aw'dw.</i> Oh that I cou'd but Conjure up the Old Philosopher,
to hear these Women pull him in pieces!</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Nay, Madam, if you are resolv'd to have the last
Word, I ha' done; for I am no lover of Words, upon my
Credit.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> I am glad to hear her say sh'as done, for I dare not
interrupt her.&mdash;Madam, your Ladyship's most humble.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Mr. <i>Praiseall</i>, Yours.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> Charming <i>Calista</i>, I kiss those enchanting Fingers.</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Humph! That might ha' been said to me more properly.      [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> Mrs. <i>Wellfed</i>, tho' last, not least.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf.</i> That's right, Mr. <i>Praiseall</i>.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> In Love, I meant, Mrs. <i>Wellfed</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Wellf.</i> Prethee, add <i>Good Tribonus</i>, don't steal by halves,
Mr. <i>Praiseall</i>.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> Lord, you are so quick!</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Well, you are come to go with us to the Rehearsal.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> 'Tis a pleasing Duty, Madam, to wait on your Ladyship:
But then to hear the wondrous Product of your
Brain, is such a Happiness, I only want some of <i>Marsilia</i>'s
Eloquence to express it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Aw'dw.</i> How this Flattery transports her! Swells her
Pride almost to bursting.           [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> I do avow, Mr. <i>Praiseall</i>, you are the most complaisant
Man of the Age.</p>

<p><i>Aw'dw.</i> Are you yet at Leisure, Madam, to tell me how
you do?</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> You see my Engagements, and have chosen a very
busie Time to ask such an insignificant Question.</p>

<p><i>Aw'dw.</i> What, it wants a Courtly Phrase?</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Must I meet with nothing but interruption? Mr.
<i>Praiseall</i>!</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> Madam?</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> I think I have not seen you these two Days.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> So long I've liv'd in <i>Greenland</i>, seen no Sun, not
felt no warmth.</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Heav'ns! Mr. <i>Praiseall</i>, why don't you write?
Words like those ought to be preserv'd in Characters indelible,
not lost in Air.</p>

<p><i>Aw'dw.</i> 'Tis pity your Ladyship does not carry a Commonplace
Book.</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> For your self 'twou'd be more useful.&mdash;&mdash;
But, as I was going to tell you, Mr. <i>Praiseall</i>, since I saw
you, I have laid a Design to alter <i>Cateline's Conspiracy</i>.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> An Undertaking fit for so great a Hand.</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Nay, I intend to make use only of the first Speech.</p>

<p><i>Aw'dw.</i> That will be an Alteration indeed!</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Your Opinion was not ask'd.
Nor wou'd I meddle with that, but to let the World, that is so
partial to those old Fellows, see the difference of a modern
Genius.&mdash;&mdash;You know that Speech, Mr. <i>Praiseall</i>, and
the Ladies too, I presume.</p>

<p><i>Calista.</i> I know it so well, as to have turn'd it into <i>Latin</i>.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> That was extraordinary. But let me tell you, Madam
<i>Calista</i>, 'tis a harder Task to mend it in <i>English</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> True, true, Mr. <i>Praiseall</i>; That all the Universe
must own.&mdash;&mdash;Patty. Give me another Glass of
Sherry, that I may speak loud and clear.&mdash;&mdash;Mr. <i>Praiseall</i>,
my Service to you.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> I kiss your unequall'd Hand.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellfed.</i> This drinking is the best part of the Entertainment
in my Opinion.           [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Now, Mr. <i>Praiseall</i>.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> I am all Ear.</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> I wou'd you were&mdash;&mdash;I was just beginning to
speak.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> Mum, I ha' done a Fault.</p>

<p><i>Aw'dw.</i> Sure this Scene will chace her from my Soul.      [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Thy Head! Thy Head! Proud City!&mdash;
I'll say no more of his; I don't love to repeat other Peoples
Works;&mdash;now my own.&mdash;
Thy solid Stones, and thy cemented Walls, this Arm shall
scatter into Atoms; then on thy Ruins will I mount!
Mount my aspiring Spirit mount! Hit yon Azure Roof, and
justle Gods;&mdash;            [<i>Ex.</i> Patty.
My Fan, my Fan, <i>Patty</i>.&mdash;       [<i>All clap.</i></p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> Ah! Poor <i>Ben</i>! Poor <i>Ben</i>! You know, Madam,
there was a famous Poet pick'd many a Hole in his Coat in
several Prefaces.&mdash;He found fault, but never mended the
Matter&mdash;Your Ladyship has lay'd his Honour in the Dust.&mdash;Poor
<i>Ben</i>! 'Tis well thou art dead; this News had broke
thy Heart.</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Then in the <i>Conspiracy</i>, I make <i>Fulvia</i> a Woman
of the nicest Honour; and such Scenes!</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf.</i> Madam, you forget the Rehearsal.</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Oh Gods! That I could live in a Cave! Ecchoes
wou'd repeat, but not interrupt me; Madam, if you are beholden
to those Creatures, I am not; let 'em wait, let 'em
wait, or live without me if they can.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Patty.</p>

<p><i>Pat.</i> Madam, your Chair Men are come.</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Let them wait, they are paid for't.</p>

<p><i>Pat.</i> Not yet to my Knowledge, what ever they be after
the third Day; there's a long Bill I'm sure.&mdash;      [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> How do you think to go Mrs. <i>Wellfed</i>? Shall <i>Pat.</i>
call you another Chair?</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf.</i> I have no Inclination to break poor Mens
Backs; I thank you, Madam, I'll go a Foot.</p>

<p><i>Calist.</i> A Foot!</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf.</i> Ay, a Foot, 'tis not far, 'twill make me leaner.
Your Servant Ladies.             [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Your Servant.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> A bouncing Dame! But she has done some things
well enough.</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Fye, Mr. <i>Praiseall</i>! That you shou'd wrong your
Judgment thus! Don't do it, because you think her my
Friend: I profess, I can't forbear saying, her Heroicks want
Beautiful Uniformity as much as her Person; and her Comedies
are as void of Jests as her Conversation.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> I submit to your Ladyship.</p>

<p><i>Aw'dw.</i> Madam, shall I crave leave to speak a few Words
with you before you go?</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> I must gratify you, tho' 'tis to my Prejudice.&mdash;My
Dear <i>Calista</i>, be pleas'd to take my Chair to the Play-House,
and I'll follow you presently.</p>

<p><i>Calist.</i> I will; but make haste.</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Fear not, yours waits below, I suppose, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> Yes Madam.</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Pray take Care of the Lady 'till I come.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> Most willingly.           [<i>Exit.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> What a ridiculous conceited thing it is!&mdash;
A witty Woman conceited, looks like a handsome Woman
set out with Frippery:</p>

<p><i>Aw'dw.</i> Railing shou'd be my part: But, <i>Marsilia</i>, I'll give
it a genteeler Name, and call it complaining.</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Pshaw! You are always a complaining I think.
Don't put me out of Humour, now I am just going to the Rehearsal.</p>

<p><i>Aw'dw.</i> Why are you so ungrateful? Is it from your Lands
water'd by <i>Helicon</i>, or my honest dirty Acres, your maintenance
proceeds? Yet I must stand like a Foot-boy, unregarded,
whilst a noisy Fool takes up your Eyes, your Ears, your
every Sense.</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Now, Mr. <i>Aw'dwell</i>, I'll tell you a strange thing: The
difference between you and I, shall create a Peace.&mdash;As thus:
You have a mind to quarrel, I have not; so that there must
be a Peace, or only War on your side. Then again, you have
a mind to stay here, I have a mind to go, which will be a
Truce at least.&mdash;            [<i>Is going.</i></p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Lucas</i>, 'Tis by the Desire of Madam <i>Maggot</i> the
Poetess, I suppose.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Cross</i>. She is a little whimsical, I think, indeed;
for this is the most incomprehensible Part I ever had in my
Life; and when I complain, all the Answer I get is, 'tis
New, and 'tis odd; and nothing but new things and odd

<p>Mr. <i>Pink.</i> Does he practice?</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Johns.</i> Walking there, much.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Pink.</i> But I mean, the Laws?</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Johns.</i> How to avoid its Penalty only. The Men are
quite tir'd with him, for you shall generally see him oagling
after the Women. He makes a shift to saunter away his Hours
till the Play begins; after you shall be sure to behold his
ill-favour'd Phyz, peeping out behind the Scenes, at both
Houses.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Pink.</i> What, at one time?</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Johns.</i> No, Faith, 'tis his moving from one House to
'tother takes up his time, which is the Commodity sticks of
his Hands, for he has neither Sense nor Patience to hear a

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf.</i> At your Service, Madam.</p>

<p><i>Calista.</i> <i>Marsilia</i> committed me to the Care of Mr. <i>Praiseall</i>;
but more powerful Charms have robb'd me of my Gallant.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf.</i> I thank Heav'n, I'm big enough to take care of
myself. Indeed to neglect a young pretty Lady, expose her
unmask'd amongst a Company of wild Players, is very dangerous.</p>

<p><i>Calist.</i> Unmask'd! Humph! I'll be ev'n with you for
that.                  [<i>Aside.</i>
Madam, I have read all your excellent Works, and I dare say,
by the regular Correction, you are a Latinist, tho' <i>Marsilia</i>
laught at it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf.</i> <i>Marsilia</i> shews her Folly, in laughing at what
she don't understand. Faith, Madam, I must own my ignorance,
I can go no further than the eight Parts of Speech.</p>

<p><i>Calist.</i> Then I cannot but take the Freedom to say, you,

<p><i>Calist.</i> Your Pardon, Madam.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> How's this? Whilst I am making Love, I shall have
my two Heroines wage War. Ladies, what's your Dispute?</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf.</i> Not worth appealing to a Judge, in my Opinion.</p>

<p><i>Calista.</i> I'll maintain it with my Life. Learning is absolutely
necessary to all who pretend to Poetry.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf.</i> We'll adjourn the Argument, <i>Marsilia</i> shall
hear the Cause.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> Ay, if you can perswade her to hold her Tongue so
long.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf.</i> I wish I cou'd engage you two in a <i>Latin</i> Dispute,

our Eyes; let us see and hear you in Perfection.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Cross</i>. This Complement is a Note above <i>Ela</i>. If <i>Marsilia</i>

shou'd not be.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Pow.</i> Yes, Madam.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> For look ye, if every Woman had lov'd her own

of their Passion takes off the Pity<i>?</i></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Oh, Mr. <i>Powell</i>, trouble not your self about the
Criticks, I am provided for them, my Prologue cools their
Courage I warrant 'em; han't you heard the Humour?</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Pow.</i> No, Madam.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I have two of your stoutest Men enter with long
Truncheons.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Pow.</i> Truncheons! Why Truncheons?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Because a Truncheon's like a Quarter-staff, has a mischievous
Look with it, and a Critick is cursedly afraid of
any thing that looks terrible.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> Why, Madam, there are abundance of Critticks,
and witty Men that are Soldiers.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Not one upon my Word, they are more Gentlemen,
than to pretend to either, a Witty Man and a Soldier; you
may as well say a modest Man, and a Courtier; Wit is always
in the Civil Power, take my Word for it; Courage, and
Honesty work hard for their Bread; Wit and Flattery feeds on
Fools, and if they are counted Wise, who keep out of
Harm's way, there's scarce a Fool now in the Kingdom.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> Why, Madam, I have always took care to keep
my self out of Harms Way, not that it is my Pretence to
Wit, for I dare look Thunder in the Face, and if you think
no Wit has Courage, what made you send for me?</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Pow.</i> Here's good Sport towards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

sent for you to vouch for mine, and not fight for your own.
Mr. <i>Powell</i>, let us mind our Cause.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> Damme, I dare fight!</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Not with me, I hope: This is all Interruption by
Heav'n!</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> 'Tis well there's not a Man asserts your Cause.      [<i>Walks about.</i></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> How Sir! Not a Man assert my Cause?</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> No, if there were, this Instant you should behold

Luck to Day&mdash;&mdash;Mr. <i>Aw'dwell</i>, your very humble Servant,
did you hear a Noise, as you came in? 'Twas I made the
Noise, Mr. <i>Aw'dwell</i>, I'll tell you how 'twas.</p>

<p><i>Aw'dw.</i> Do, for I am resolv'd to justifie the Lady.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> Then you must know, I was trying to act one
of <i>Marsillia's</i> Heroes, a horrible blustring Fellow<i>!</i> That
made me so loud, Sir; now, says Mr. <i>Powell</i>, you do it awkerdly;
whip says I, in answer like a Chollerick Fool, and
out comes Poker, whether <i>George</i> was out so soon I can't
say.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. <i>Pow.</i> How Sir<i>!</i> my Sword in the Scabbard, and
your's drawn!</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> Nay, nay, may be it was <i>George</i>, but now we
are as good Friends as ever, witness this hearty Hug!
(to <i>Mars.</i>) Madam, I invented this Story to prevent your Rehearsals
being interrupted.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I thank you Sir, your Cowardize has kept Quietness.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> Your Servant Madam, I shall find a time.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Aw'dw.</i> So shall I!</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> 'Tis hard tho' one can't speak a Word to a Lady
without being over-heard.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Come Mr. <i>Aw'dwell</i>, sit down, I am oblig'd to you
for what you have done, but this Fellow may make a Party
for me at the Coffee-house; therefore prithee let him alone,
tho' I believe my Play won't want it.&mdash;Now clear the Stage;
Prompter give me the Book! Oh, Mr. <i>Powell</i>, you must stay,
I shall want your Advice; I'll tell ye time enough for your
Entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Pow.</i> Madam, give me leave to take a Glass of Sack,
I am qualmish.</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Oh! Fie, Mr. <i>Powell</i>, we'll have Sack here; d'ye
see Ladies, you have teaz'd Mr. <i>Powell</i> sick: Well, Impertinence,
in a Woman is the Devil!</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf.</i> Shall we stay to be affronted?</p>

<p><i>Calista.</i> Prithee let's stay, and laugh at her <i>Opera</i>, as she
calls it, for I hear 'tis a very foolish one.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Come Prologue-Speakers! Prologue Speakers! Where
are you? I shall want Sack my self, by and by, I believe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Two Men with Whiskers, large Truncheons,
Drest strangely.</i></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Lord, Mr. <i>Powell</i>, these Men are not half tall enough,
nor half big enough! What shall I do for a larger
sort of Men?</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Pow.</i> Faith, Madam, I can't tell, they say the Race
diminishes every Day.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Ay, so they do with a witness, Mr. <i>Powell</i>. Oh,
these puny Fellows will spoil the Design of my Prologue!
Hark ye! Mr. <i>Powell</i>, you know the huge tall Monster, that
comes in one Play, which was taken Originally from <i>Bartholomew-fair</i>
Against this, is spoke Publickly; cou'd not we
contrive to dress up two such things, twou'd set the Upper-Gallery
a Clapping like mad? And let me tell you, Mr.
<i>Powell</i>, that's a Clapping not to be despis'd.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Pow.</i> We'll see what may be done; But, Madam, you
had as good hear these speak it now.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Well, Sheep-biters, begin!</p>

<p><i>1st.</i>&mdash;&mdash;Well, Brother Monster, what do you do here!</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> Ah! And t'other looks no more like a Monster than
I do; speak it fuller in the Mouth Dunce.
Well, Brother Monster, what do you do here?</p>

<p><i>1st.</i>&mdash;&mdash;Well, Brother Monster, what do you do here?</p>

<p><i>2d.</i>&mdash;&mdash;I come to put the Criticks in a mortal Fear.</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> O Heav'ns! You shou'd have every thing that is
terrible in that Line! You shou'd speak it like a Ghost, like a
Giant, like a Mandrake, and you speak it like a Mouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Pow.</i> Madam, if you won't let 'em proceed, we shan't
do the first Act this Morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I have no Patience! I wish you wou'd be a Monster,
Mr. <i>Powell</i>, for once, but then I cou'd not match you neither.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Pow.</i> I thank you Madam, come, these will mend with
Practice.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i>&mdash;&mdash;Come begin then, and go thro' with it roundly.</p>

<p><i>1st.</i>&mdash;&mdash;Well, Brother Monster, what do you do here<i>?</i></p>

<p><i>2d.</i>&mdash;&mdash;I come to put the Critticks in a mortal Fear.</p>

<p><i>1st.</i>&mdash;&mdash;I'm also sent upon the same Design.</p>

<p><i>2d.</i>&mdash;&mdash;Then let's our heavy Trunchions shake and joyn.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Ah! The Devil take thee, for a squeaking Treble<i>!</i>
D'ye mention shaking your Trunchions, and not so much as
stir 'em, Block! By my hopes of <i>Cataline</i>, you shall never
speak it, give me the Papers quickly.</p>

Lord! Lord! I shan't recover my Humour again, this half

<p>Mr. <i>Pow.</i> Why do you vex your self, so much, Madam?</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Aw'dw.</i> Poetry ought to be for the use of the Mind,
and for the Diversion of the Writer, as well as the Spectator;
but to you, sure Madam, it proves only a Fatigue and
Toyl.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Pray, Mr. <i>Aw'dwell</i>, don't come here to make your
Remarks; what, I shan't have the Priviledge to be in a Passion
for you! Shall I; how dare you contradict me?</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> But you shall be in a Passion, if you have a
mind to it, by the Clubb of <i>Hercules</i>. Ah! Madam, if we
had but <i>Hercules</i>, <i>Hercules</i> and his Clubb wou'd ha' done
rarely: Dear Madam! Let 'em have Clubbs next time, do
Madam, let 'em ha' Clubbs; let it be my Thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

they shan't have Clubbs, tho' I like Clubbs better my self too.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> I ha' done, I ha' done.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> O Heav'ns! Now I have lost Mr. <i>Powell</i>, with your
Nonsensical Clubbs, wou'd there was a lusty one about your
empty Pate.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> I ha' done, I ha' done, Madam.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Mr. <i>Powell</i>! Mr. <i>Powell</i>!</p>

<p><i>Scene-Keeper</i>&mdash;He's gone out of the House, Madam.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Oh the Devil! Sure I shall go distracted! Where's
this Book? Come we'll begin the Play: Call my Lady
<i>Loveall</i>, and <i>Betty Useful</i> her Maid: Pray keep a clear
Stage.
Now look you, Mr. <i>Praiseall</i>, 'thas been the receiv'd Opinion,
and Practice in all your late <i>Operas</i> to take care of the Songish
part, as I may call it, after a great Man; and for the Play,
it might be the History of <i>Tom Thumb</i>; no matter how, I
have done just contrary, took care of the Language and Plot;
and for the Musick, they that don't like it, may go whistle.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Aw'dw.</i> Why wou'd you chuse to call it an <i>Opera</i>
then?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Lord! Mr. <i>Aw'dwell</i>, I han't time to answer every
impertinent Question.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> No Sir! We han't time, it was the Ladys Will,
and that's Allmighty Reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Aw'dw.</i> I shall have an Opportunity to Kick that Fellow.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I wonder my Lord Duke's not come, nor Sir <i>Thomas</i>.
Bless me! What a Disorder my dress is in? Oh!
These People will give me the Spleen intollerablly! Do they
design ever to enter or no? My Spirits are quite gone!

<p><i>Mars.</i> Mrs. <i>Wellfed</i>, you know where to get good Wine;
pray speak for some, then perhaps we shall keep Mr. <i>Powell</i>.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Wellf.</i> I'll take care of it, I warrant you.</p>

<p><i>Mars.</i> I knew 'twas a pleasing Errand.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Come Child, speak handsomly, this Part will do
you a Kindness.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Why do those Eyes, Loves Tapers, that on whomsoe'er
they are fixt, kindle straight Desire, now seem to Nod,
and Wink, and hardly Glimmer in their Sockets?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Mr. <i>Praiseall</i>, is not that Simile well carried on?</p>

Useful</i> has been the Contriver, Guide and close Concealer
of your Pleasures: <i>Amorous</i> the Steward, you know, is
yours; the Butler too bows beneath your Conquering
Charms, and you have vow'd your Wishes in your own Family
shou'd be confin'd, who then of Worth remains?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Good Mrs. <i>Knight</i> speak that as passionately as you
can, because you are going to Swoon, you know; and I hate
Women shou'd go into a Swoon, as some of our Authors
make 'em, without so much as altering their Face, or
Voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>La. <i>Lov.</i>&mdash;&mdash;Madam, I never knew <i>Betty</i> sound well
in Heroick.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Why, no Mrs <i>Knight</i>, therefore in that lies the Art,
for you to make it sound well; I think I may say, without
a Blush, I am the first that made Heroick natural.</p>

<p>La. <i>Lov.</i> I'll do my best.
Oh! <i>Betty</i>! <i>Betty!</i> Fear and Love, like meeting Tides, o'erwhelm
me, the rowling Waves beat sinking Nature down,
and Ebbbing Life retires!                                 [<i>Swoons.</i></p>

Clap for a Guinea: 'Gad if there is not, I shall scarce forbear
telling the Audience they are uncivil.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> Nor, Gad, I shall scarce forbear Fighting 'em one
by one. But hush! Now let's hear what <i>Betty</i> says.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Oh! My poor Lady! Look up, fair Saint! Oh close
not those bright Eyes! If 'tis in <i>Betty's</i> Power, they shall
still be feasted with the Object of their Wishes.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> Well said, honest <i>Betty</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Nay, She is so throughout the whole Play, to the
very last, I assure you.</p>

<p>La. <i>Lov.</i> Yes, he shall be mine! Let Law, and Rules,
confine the creeping Stoick, the cold lifeless Hermit, or the
Dissembling Brethren of Broad Hats, and narrow Bands;
I am a Libertine, and being so, I love my Husband's Son, and
will enjoy him.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> There's a Rant for you! Oh Lord! Mr. <i>Praiseall</i>,
look how Mrs. <i>Betty</i>'s surpriz'd: Well, she doth a silent Surprize
the best i'th' World; I must kiss her, I cannot help it,
'tis incomparable! Now speak Mrs <i>Betty</i>, now speak.</p>

with which he comes slowly on, and beneath this Courteous
Roof rests this Night his wearied Head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>La. <i>Lov.</i>&mdash;&mdash;Let me have Musick then, to melt him
down; he comes and meets this Face to charm him. 'Tis
done! 'Tis done! By Heav'n, I cannot bear the reflected
Glories of those Eyes, all other Beauties fly before me.</p>

her, for she is nobly generous, and pays for Pleasure, as dear

why, I fear not him, he is an old Book-worm, never out
of his Study; and whilst he finds out a way to the Moon,

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> 'Tis amazingly fine!</p>

and Scandal are a Feast for them who have past
the Line of Shame: <i>Amorous</i> has a Wife, and <i>Isabella</i>

work.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Now make haste off, Mrs. <i>Betty</i>, as if you were

out a new way to the Moon?</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> Yes marry did I, and I was thinking to ask if
I might not go with him, for I have a great mind to see
the Moon World.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> And you shall see it all, and how they live in't,
before the Play's done, here they have talked of the Emperour
of the Moon, and the World in the Moon, but discovered
nothing of the Matter; Now, again, I go just contrary;
for I say nothing, and shew all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> Gad forgive me for a Sot; Faith I han't minded
it.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Why, to tell you the Truth, 'tis not yet resolv'd;
but it must be in some warm Climate, where the Sun
has power, and where there's Orange Groves; for <i>Isabella</i>,
you'll find, Loves walking in Orange Groves.</p>

most of our Oranges, and Lemons from thence.</p>

of strong Aversion: Oh had your Fate but thrown you on my
Lady, her very Eyes had rais'd your Passion up to Madness.</p>

that unextinguish'd Fire, that with the smallest Fuel burns,

wide, discover your goodly Figure, each Morn the Idol's

<p><i>Aw'dwell.</i> Pray, Madam, who is this Dance to entertain?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> What, do you sit an Hour to study a cross Question?
Why, to satisfie you, Sir, you are to suppose <i>Fastin</i>, in
passing towards his Mothers Lodgings, may, out of some
Gallery, see it; now you are answered.</p>

<p><i>Aw'dw.</i> I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> Ay, and sufficiently too: A Gallery Balcony,
twenty Peepholes.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Mrs.</i> Cross</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Cross</i>. Madam, I cou'd wish you wou'd not be disoblig'd
if I gave up this Part, I shall get my self, nor you,
no Credit by it.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> How, Mrs. <i>Cross</i>! Disoblig'd! Assure your self, I
shall resent it ill to the last Degree, what throw up my Heroine!
my <i>Isabella</i>! Was there ever a Character more Chaste,
more Noble, or more Pitiful?</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Cross</i>. Yes, very Chaste, when I am in Love with
my Father-in-Law's Steward, I know not why, nor wherefore.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Mrs. <i>Cross</i>, I maintain, no Woman in the Play-House,
nor out of the Play-house, can be chaster than I
ma'e <i>Isabella</i>, but trouble your Head no further, I'll do the
Part my self.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Cross</i>. With all my Heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> And let me tell you Mistress <i>Cross</i>, I shall command
whatever is in the Wardrobe, I assure you!</p>

<p>Mrs <i>Cross</i>. Any of my Gowns are at your Service, if
they'll fit you, Madam.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Nay, they shall be; perhaps, without boasting, I
command them, that command you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Cross</i>. Perhaps 'tis not worth boasting on; there's your
part.                                            [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> A little inconsiderable Creature! Well, she shall see
how much better 'twill be done, and for meer madness,
hang her self in her own Garters. Mrs. <i>Wellfed</i>, I'll wear a
white Feather, That, I believe, will become me best. <i>Patty</i>,
is <i>Patty</i> there?</p>

<p><i>Pat.</i> Yes, Madam.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> <i>Patty</i>, run to the Exchange, bring me a Dozen yards
of Scarlet Ribbon; and d'ye hear <i>Patty</i>? Some shining
Patches, some Pulvil and Essence, my Lord Duke shall help
me to Jewels, throw up her part! I'll fit her, let her see
how the Town will receive her, after I have trode the Stage.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Aw'dw.</i> Why, Madam, you are not in earnest!</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> By my hopes of <i>Catiline</i>, I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Aw'dw.</i> For Heav'ns sake, don't make your self so irrecoverably
rediculous.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> Do, Madam, I say, 'Gad, I'll make such a Party<i>!</i>
Gad, I'll do nothing but clap, from the time I come into
the House, 'till I go out; Ouns, I'll be hang'd if it don't
bring a Swindging Audience, on the third day.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Aw'dw.</i> To dance naked on the third Day, wou'd
bring a bigger Audience; Why don't you perswade the Lady
to that?                        [<i>Speaking loud to</i> Marsillia.</p>

<p>Do, <i>Marsillia</i>, be rul'd by your Vanity, and that good
Friend, Mr. <i>Praiseall</i>; but rest assur'd, after such a weakness,
I will never see your Face again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Ha! I must not loose him. (<i>aside</i>) Why, Mr. <i>Aw'dwell</i>,
wou'd you have such a hopeful Play lost? Can you be so
unreasonable to desire it? And that Part ruins all.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Aw'dwell</i>. Give me the Part, and I'll try to perswade
Mrs. <i>Cross</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Do, that's a good Boy; and I won't disoblige him
this two days.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Aw'dw.</i> Is't possible! Will you dine at your own Lodgings
to day? I'll give Order for some Dishes of Meat
there?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Yes, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Aw'dw.</i> Don't serve me now, as you did when I provided
a handsome Dinner for you at my own House; and
you whiskt to <i>Chelsy</i>, in a Coach, with the Lord knows
who.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> No, I scorn it.                  [<i>Exit Mr.</i> Aw'dwell.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> You was talking of Wine, there is some within;
pray take a Recruit before you proceed.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> A good Motion, wait upon these two Ladies in, and
I'll follow; I must practice a little, least Mrs. <i>Cross</i> shou'd
prove stubborn, and then, not my Father's Ghost shou'd hinder
me.</p>

<p><i>Pat.</i> My Lord <i>Whiffle</i> is come to wait on your Ladyship,

in a Corner of my head intire, where no other Thought
shall presume to interpose. Confound me, if my damn'd
Barber has not made me look like a Mountebank: This

having seen his Mother-in-Law, is wholly captivated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
her Charms, and <i>Betty</i> and she have both foresworn the
Consummation of her Marriage with <i>Fastin's</i> Father; so he
takes her to an adjacent Castle of his; she having cast the
old Philosopher in a deep sleep. I'm forc't to tell your
Lordship this, because the Play does not mention it.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Awd.</i> I am afraid your Ladyship will be wanted,
like the <i>Chorus</i> of Old, to enlighten the understanding of
the Audience.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Meer Malice, Spight, and burning Malice, by the
Gods!</p>

<p>L. <i>Whiff.</i> Very good, my Coat is as full of wrinkles
as an Old Woman's Face, by <i>Jove</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> Madam, han't they took <i>Betty</i> with 'em to his
Castle?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Yes, yes; But, Mr. <i>Praisall</i>, you must keep your
Distance a little now, and not interrupt me, when I am
talking to my Lord.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> I am dumb as a fish.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Now, if your Lordship pleases to sit down, you
will see my <i>Opera</i> begin; for tho' some of the Play is
over, there has been no Scene Operaish yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Awd.</i> Operaish! Thats' a word of your own, I suppose,
Madam.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> Ne're the worse for that, I hope, Sir; why mayn't
the Ladies make a word as well as the Men?</p>

<p>L. <i>Whiff.</i> Madam, I am all Attention.</p>

Glorious by a Thousand burning Lights: By Heav'ns my
words run of themselves into Heroick! Now Let em' enter.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Fastin, <i>Lady</i> Loveall.</p>

<p><i>Fast.</i> Cou'd Age expect to hold thee! Oh thou Heav'nly
Charmer! was there such an Impudence in Impotence; if
the old Dotard has liv'd past his Reason, he must be taught
it; yes, it shall dazle in his Eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Awd.</i> A very Dutiful Son, this.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Sir, I desire your Absence, if you won't let the
Players go on: His Father has done a very foolish thing;
and must be call'd to an account for it.</p>

<p>L. <i>Whif.</i> Right Madam; all old Men do foolish things
when they marry young Wives, and ought to meet with
exemplary Punishments.</p>

thing&mdash;&mdash;Mrs. <i>Knight</i>, if you please.</p>

my Heart dances to the Musick of your Vows. But is there
no Falshood in a Form so lovely! if there is, these Eyes
that let the Object in, must weep for ever!</p>

<p><i>Fast.</i> By Honour and by Glory, I love thee more than
Mortal can express or bear.</p>

<p>L. <i>Whiff.</i> Madam, they exceed any of our modern
Flights, as far as a Description of <i>Homer</i>'s does Mr. <i>Settle</i>'s,
Poet in Ordinary for my Lord Mayor's Show.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> After what my Lord has said, I dare not speak,
but I am all Admiration,</p>

Interruption; my Friends here will treat me with Flattery.</p>

it none. (<i>aside.</i>) Nor <i>Isabella</i> shall not&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fast.</i> Be nam'd only for Punishment, her Adultery with
<i>Amorous</i> is plain, therefore she shall be disgrac'd, and dye.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Awd.</i> Who had told him this?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Why <i>Betty</i> had told him, tho' <i>Isabella</i>' was Innocent
as to the matter of Fact. Indeed Fate over-rul'd her Inclination:
I will not answer you another Question, I protest:
find it out as the rest of the World does.</p>

<p><i>Fastin</i> to his Attendants.) Guard the Orange Grove;
there let <i>Isabella</i> remain a Prisoner, whilst I entertain the
fair <i>Clemene</i> with a Song and Dances here.</p>

there secure; in the mean time my Men fall on upon his

Patience with their dull stuff? But, as I was saying, I
must beg you once again to suppose old Lord <i>Whimsical Loveall</i>,
is attacking his Son's Castle, and beaten back: Now they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
behind the Scenes; found a Storm again, three times;
now we'll suppose 'em repuls'd. And from the Castle let
the Trumpets and Violins join in a Tune of Victory. So,
there's a Battle well over.</p>

<p>L. <i>Whiff.</i> With a very little trouble. But, Madam had
not the storming the Castle been as good a Scene as the taking
of <i>Jerusalem</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Granted, my Lord. But I have a Castle taken upon
the Stage; and twice, you know, had been Repetition.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> True; your Ladiship was never in the wrong
in your Life, unless it was when you said, I had no Courage.</p>

in't, made me backward.</p>

my sick Brain. Yet it cannot be Delusion; for I am a Prisoner.
A surly Fellow, who lookt as if Pity was his Foe,
told me, I here must wait my Lord's Commands. Oh,

sent to my Fathers Castle, to begin the Parly? 'Tis true,

in Urns, and vainly warm the Dead, so Useless is my

<p><i>Mar.</i> My Lord, my Lord, this will make you amends for
your Snuff! Drums beat; mount, ye Lumpish Dogs: what
are you afraid of? you know the Stones are only Wool:
Faster, with more Spirit? Brutes. Oh <i>Jehu</i>! I am sorry I
had not this Castle taken by women, then t'had been done

us in the Cellar neither.                       (<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> Well said, Mrs. <i>Betty</i>; she loves a Cup, I like
her the better for't.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Awd.</i> A hopeful Wife, this! do's she go on thus Triumphant?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I have sworn to answer you no more Questions.</p>

<p>L. <i>Whiff.</i> Indeed, Madam, you have made her very wicked.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> The woman is a little Mischievous; but your Lordship
shall see I'll bring her to Condign Punnishment. My
Lord, I will be bold to say, here is a Scene a coming, wherein
there is the greatest Distress that ever was seen in a Play:
'tis poor <i>Amorous</i>, and <i>Isabella</i>. Mr. <i>Praisall</i>, do you remember
that old <i>Whimsicall</i> was all along a Philosopher<i>?</i>
Come let down the Chariot.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> Lord Madam, do you think I don't, why was
not he and I a going to the Moon together?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Right! you must keep a steady, and a solid Thought
to find the Depths of this plot out. Now, my Lord, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
pleas'd once again to conceive these poor Lovers hunted above
the Castle, at last taking Sanctuary in a high pair of
Leads, which adjoyns to the old Man's study; conceive
also their Enemies at their Heels; how then can these lost
Creatures 'scape?</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Awd.</i> May be they both leapt over the Leads, and
broke their Necks.</p>

<p>L. <i>Whiff.</i> That's one way; but pray lets hear the Ladies.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> You must know, my Lord, at first I design'd this
for Tragedy; and they were both taken; She was
Poyson'd, and dy'd, like an Innocent Lamb, as she was indeed:
I was studying a Death for him; once I thought
Boys shou'd shoot him to Death with Pot-Guns: for your
Lordship may be pleas'd to understand, <i>Amorous</i> had been a
Soldier, tho' now he was a Steward of the Family; and
that wou'd have been Disgrace enough, you know: But at
length I resolv'd to ram him into a great Gun, and
scatter him o're the sturdy Plain: This, I say, was my first
resolve. But I consider'd, 'twould break the Lady's Heart;
so there is nothing in their Parts Tragical but as your Lordship
shall see miraculously I turn'd it into an Opera.</p>

<p>L. <i>Whif.</i> Your Ladyship's Wit is Almighty, and produces
nothing but Wonders.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> The Devil take his Lordship, he is always before
hand with me, and goes so confounded high, there's no
coming after him.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Your Lordship shall see what, I think, their Opera's
have not yet had.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

Is there no God that Pities Innocence? Oh! thou All-seeing
Sun, contract thy Glorious Beam's, hide me, in Darkness
hide me!</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Awd.</i> I am sorry to find your Heroine Shrink.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Oh! 'tis more natural for a woman than bold; as
an Imprison'd Cat, to fly Death i th Face, as 'twere. Humph,
was it you I took pains to convince? Pray no more Interruption
of this Scene.</p>

<p><i>Amor.</i> Ten Massy Doors, all barr'd with wondrous
strength impede their Passage: Rest then, thou Milk-white
hunted Hind, forget the near Approach of fear, and hear the
Story of my Love.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Awd.</i> Hey boy, little <i>Amorous</i>! He'll loose no opportunity.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> He is not like to have many; he was a fool,
if he did not improve 'em.</p>

Pleasure? By Heav'n, 'twould be a noble Justice to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
defeat their Malice: they hunt us for imaginary Crimes;
and we must dye like Fools for doing nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> Well urg'd, <i>Amorous</i>.</p>

<p>L. <i>Whiff.</i> Bold, I vow.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> A Lover shou'd be so, my Lord.</p>

<p><i>Amor.</i> But give me up the Heav'n my ravenous Love requires:
Let me fill my Sences with thy Sweetness; then
let 'em pour upon me, I cou'd laugh at all their idle
Tortures, every pleas'd Limb shou'd dance upon the
Wheel.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Dance upon the Wheel! that's a new thought, I am
sure, my Lord.</p>

<p>L. <i>Whiff.</i> Your Tract is all new, and must be uncommon,
because others can never find it.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> A Pox on him! he has out-done me agen.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I am your Lordship's very humble Servant: My
Lord, How <i>Amorous</i> gazes on her!</p>

<p>L. <i>Whiff.</i> Piercing Eyes, I confess.</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> An irresistible Lere&mdash;&mdash;I got in a word.</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Take off your Eyes; mine shou'd be fix'd above; but
Love draws 'em downwards, and almost pulls my Heart along.</p>

<p><i>Amo.</i> Give me your Heart! your Arms! Oh! give me all!
see at your Feet the wretched <i>Amorous</i> falls! Be not more
cruel than our Foes. Behold me on the Torture! <i>Fastin</i> cannot
Punish me with half the Racks denying Beauty lays on
longing Love.</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> I recover strength: rise, and begone; Alas, thou
can'st not go; then at awful distance, cold as Ice, not dare
to let thy hot Breath agen offend my chaste Ears! If thou
hast, a Dagger rams thy Passion down thy Throat.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Won't this be a Surprize, my Lord, to see her have
such an Icy Fit?</p>

<p>L. <i>Whiff.</i> When I thought she was just going to melt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Amor.</i> See, you are obey'd; shivering your er'e-while raging
Lover stands; your Words and Looks, like Frost on
Flowers, have nipt my Hopes and fierce Desires!</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> Alas, poor <i>Amorous</i>!      (<i>A Noise without.</i></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Do you hear, my Lord? do's not your Heart ake
for the poor Lovers?</p>

<p>L. <i>Whif.</i> I am ready to swoon, Madam.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> Wou'd I had some Cordial-water.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Awd.</i> Art thou <i>Marsilia</i>? wilt thou confess it? so
weak to believe these Coxcombs?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I always choose to believe what pleases me best. If a
School-Boy had been told so often of a Fault, as you have
been, of Interruption, he had certainly left it. Make a Noise
agen without.</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Alas my fears return; what shall I do? I dare not
dye.</p>

<p><i>Amor.</i> Oh Let not Monstrous Fear deform the Beauties of
thy Soul, but brave thy Fate.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Louder; but brave thy Fate; strain your Voice: I
tell you, Mr. <i>Pinkethman</i>, this speaking Loud gets the
Clap.</p>

<p><i>Amo.</i> Pox of this Heroick; I shall tear my Lungs. (<i>Aside.</i>
But brave thy Fate.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Aye, that goes to ones very Heart.</p>

<p><i>Awd.</i> And rends ones Head.</p>

wonder; this very Chariot <i>Whimsical</i> had been making fifty
Years, contriv'd beyond all humane Art, for the Sun to
draw up to the Moon; at this very Critical minute the
Matter's affected. Is not your Lordship surpriz'd<i>?</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>L. <i>Whif.</i> I know not where I am!</p>

<p><i>Prais.</i> Oh! this is a plain case; so while the old Cuckold
was watching his Chariot, his Wife had Opportunity to
make him one.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Right, right, Mr. <i>Praisall</i>: Now <i>Amorous</i> finds it
move.</p>

<p><i>Amor.</i> Ha! the Chariot moves; a Miracle is known in our
Preservation.</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Oh! I dye with fear!</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Now she falls in a Swoon, and never wakes 'till they
come into another world.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> E gad, 'tis well I am not in the Chariot with
her.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> You may open the Door, they are out of sight.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Fastin, <i>Lady</i> Loveall <i>and</i> Betty.</p>

<p><i>Fast.</i> Where is the Hellish Pair? Let my Eyes be fasten'd
on 'em, that I may look 'em dead.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Look dreadfully, sweet Mr. <i>Powell</i>, look dreadfully.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Awd.</i> Hark'e, Madam, only one thing; did you never
hear an old Proverb; <i>He that has a House of Glass shou'd
never throw Stones at his Neighbours</i>? I think this young
Gentleman is guilty of much the same fault.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Lord! Lord! I told ye once before, he did not
know his Father was marry'd to her, he took her for a pure
Virgin. Come, Mr. <i>Powell</i>, go on.</p>

<p><i>Fast.</i> Where are you hid? in what Lustful Corner?</p>

coming.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Prais.</i> I am silent as the Grave.</p>

evading it; for if the Earth holds 'em, they shall be
found.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Why, where's my old Master's Conjuring Chariot,
I wonder, that he alway's told us wou'd carry him to Heaven,
when we little thought on't? It us'd to stand here.</p>

<p>L. <i>Lov.</i> It did so.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Perhaps they are gone to <i>Elyzium</i> in it.</p>

<p>L. <i>Lov.</i> No, Fool, <i>Elyzium</i> has no room for Lawless Lovers.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Then you must never come there, I'm sure.      (<i>aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> That's the first ill word <i>Betty</i> has given her Mistress;
and that was to her self too.</p>

<p><i>Fast.</i> Let my Chariots be prepar'd, we'll leave this hated
place, and in my Castle unlade our Cares. Love shall crown
our Hours, and Wine and Musick rob 'em of 'em with delight.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
